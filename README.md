java-8-examples
===============

## Getting Started

You'll two key components, and one optional.

### Java 8

You'll need to download the Java 8 JDK from Orcale's website. (You need the JDK, the JRE is not enough).

### Maven

The project is Mavenized, so you'll need the Maven build plugin.

http://maven.apache.org/

### Eclipse IDE (Optional)

If you are going to use Eclipse as your IDE of choice you will need the project Luna build I20140318-0830 or later. When I downloaded it that build was not in release, so you may have to grab a nightly or integration test build in order to get Java 8 support.


## Build the Project 

Run the following command at the command line - ```mvn install```.

The project should now be ready to work with.
